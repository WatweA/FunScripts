# Some Scripts I Wrote

- [Russel 1000 Selector](https://github.com/WatweA/FunScripts/blob/24013f16e40f60a07699cc12feea0faee67da890/random_russell.py)
  - This a script that scrapes the component stocks of the iShares Russell 1000 ETF by BlackRock. It prints out a random 10 components from the index on each run, which allows the user to replicate the strategy outlined in [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street) by __Burton Gordon Malkiel__. _Disclaimer: this is not financial advice :)_
